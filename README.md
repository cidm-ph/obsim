# obsim

> **Outbreak simulation based on a branching process**

Simulate outbreaks of a communicable disease.
This is both a simulation framework and an implementation that uses very
simplistic modelling assumptions.

## How to use

This is a Rust library, and can be added to your `Cargo.toml` with:

```toml
[dependencies]
obsim = { git = "https://github.com/cidm-ph/obsim" }
```

See the [development documentation](https://cidm-ph.github.io/obsim/obsim).

You do not necessarily need to be familiar with Rust to make use of this
library as it comes with some [examples](./examples) that you can modify.
See [Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get set up.
With the repository checked out, you can edit the configuration in the examples
and then e.g. `cargo run --example simple > simulation.fa` to get an annotated
FASTA file with the simulation result.

## Purpose

The currently implemented models are too simplistic to capture many real
features of microbial evolution. They are intended for simple approximations
that apply on short timescales where only a few mutations are expected to occur
over the duration of outbreaks.

The framework can be extended with more sophisticated models using the same
simple interfaces to drive simulations.
