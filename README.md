> **Outbreak simulation based on a branching process**

Simulate outbreaks of a communicable disease.
This is both a simulation framework and an implementation that uses very
simplistic modelling assumptions.

## How to use

This is a Rust library, but comes with some [examples](./examples) that you can modify.
See [Installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to get set up.

With the repository checked out, you can run these examples with e.g.
`cargo run --example simple` to get an annotated FASTA file with the simulation result.

## Purpose

The currently implemented models are too simplistic to capture many real
features of microbial evolution. They are intended for simple approximations
that apply on short timescales where only a few mutations are expected to occur
over the duration of outbreaks.

The framework can be extended with more sophisticated models using the same
simple interfaces to drive simulations.
